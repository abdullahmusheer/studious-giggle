# Creating Inventory for spare parts 
Using VLOOKUP for Inventory Management
<br>
<br>

<i>Hello,
  <br>
I created this file to manage the spare parts (in this case Air Filters) stock and inventory. My existing employer owns multiple commercial property(s) and it was a challenge maintaining an inventory for all kinds and sizes of filters. 
In this small project, I did the following:
  <br>
1. Collected all data related to each property air filters and their respective sizes
2. Created a filter masterlist and assigned each filter based on its size and property a reference code
3. Created an inventory system using VlookUP function 
<br>
 <br> 
 Conclusion:
 This file now helps team members in :
  1.Knowing the inventory status at a current time
  2.Subsequently ordering more filters in advance(especially with supply chain problems due to covid)
  3.Pull out cost of filters for individual property.This helps in charging back to the individual customers.

Have a good day!
