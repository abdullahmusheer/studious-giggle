Using VLOOKUP for Inventory Management
<i>Hello,
I created this file to manage the spare parts (in this case Air Filters) stock and inventory. My existing employer owns multiple commercial property(s) and it was a challenge maintaining an inventory for all kinds and sizes of filters. 
In this small project, I did the following:
1. Collected all data related to each property air filters and their respective sizes
2. Created a filter masterlist and assigned each filter based on its size and property a reference code
3. Created an inventory system using VlookUP function </i>
